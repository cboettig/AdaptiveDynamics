Description: Uses fast C++ code to implement individual ecological dynamics of births and deaths with occassional random mutations, resulting in evolutionary trajectories that can be captured using the tools of adaptive dynamics.  
Depends: odesolve, snowfall 
SystemRequirements: GSL libraries (libgsl0-dev), OpenMP libraries (libiomp-dev)
